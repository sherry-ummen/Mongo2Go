Mongo2Go - MongoDB for integration tests & local debugging
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Mongo2Go/Mongo2Go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Mongo2Go/Mongo2Go) Linux Build (Ubuntu Trusty)           
 [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/u9mp0ceh57sdsx97/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JohannesHoppe/mongo2go-pc320/branch/master) Windows Build (Windows Server 2016)



Mongo2Go is a managed wrapper around the latest MongoDB binaries.
It targets **.NET Standard 1.6** (and **.NET 4.6** for legacy environments) and works with Windows, Linux and macOS.
This Nuget package contains the executables of _mongod_, _mongoimport_ and _mongoexport_ **for Windows, Linux and macOS** .

__Brought to you by [Johannes Hoppe](https://haushoppe-its.de), follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johanneshoppe).__ 

Mongo2Go has two use cases:

1. Providing multiple, temporary and isolated MongoDB databases for unit tests (or to be precise: integration tests)
2. Providing a quick to set up MongoDB database for a local developer environment


Unit Test / Integration test
-------------------------------------
With each call of the static method **MongoDbRunner.Start()** a new MongoDB instance will be set up.
A free port will be used (starting with port 27018) and a corresponding data directory will be created.
The method returns an instance of MongoDbRunner, which implements IDisposable.
As soon as the MongoDbRunner is disposed (or if the Finalizer is called by the GC),
the wrapped MongoDB process will be killed and all data in the data directory will be deleted.


Local debugging
------------------------
In this mode a single MongoDB instance will be started on the default port (27017).
No data will be deleted and the MongoDB instance won’t be killed automatically.
Multiple calls to **MongoDbRunner.StartForDebugging()** will return an instance with the State “AlreadyRunning”.
You can ignore the IDisposable interface, as it won’t have any effect.
**I highly recommend to not use this mode on productive machines!**
Here you should set up a MongoDB as it is described in the manual.
For you convenience the MongoDbRunner also exposes _mongoexport_ and _mongoimport_
which allow you to quickly set up a working environment.


Single server replica set mode to enable transactions 
-------------------------
`MongoDbRunner.Start()` can be set up to take in an optional boolean parameter called `singleNodeReplSet`.
When passed in with the value `true` - (**`MongoDbRunner.Start(singleNodeReplSet: true)`**)
- a single node mongod instance will be started as a replica set with the name `singleNodeReplSet`.
Replica set mode is required for transactions to work in MongoDB 4.0 or greater

Additional mongod arguments
---------------------------
`MongoDbRunner.Start()` can be set up to consume additional `mongod` arguments.
This can be done using the string parameter called `additionalMongodArguments`.
The list of additional arguments cannot contain arguments already defined internally by Mongo2Go. An `ArgumentException` will be thrown in this case, specifying which additional arguments are required to be discarded.
Example of usage of the additional `mongod` arguments: **`MongoDbRunner.Start(additionalMongodArguments: "--quiet")`**

Installation
--------------
The Mongo2Go Nuget package can be found at [https://nuget.org/packages/Mongo2Go/](https://nuget.org/packages/Mongo2Go/)

Search for „Mongo2Go“ in the Manage NuGet Packages dialog box or run:

    PM> Install-Package Mongo2Go

or run for the legacy **.NET 4.6** package:

    PM> Install-Package Mongo2Go -Version 1.1.0

in the Package Manager Console. 

* The new 2.x branch targets __.NET Standard 1.6__, please use the latest packages if possible. 
* The old 1.x branch targets good-old classic __.NET 4.6.1__. This is for legacy environments only. No new features will be added, only bugfixes will be made.


Examples
--------

**Example: Integration Test (here: Machine.Specifications & Fluent Assertions)**

```c#
[Subject("Runner Integration Test")]
public class when_using_the_inbuild_serialization : MongoIntegrationTest
{
    static TestDocument findResult;
    
    Establish context = () =>
        {
            CreateConnection();
            _collection.Insert(TestDocument.DummyData1());
        };

    Because of = () => findResult = _collection.FindOneAs<TestDocument>();

    It should_return_a_result = () => findResult.ShouldNotBeNull();
    It should_hava_expected_data = () => findResult.ShouldHave().AllPropertiesBut(d => d.Id).EqualTo(TestDocument.DummyData1());

    Cleanup stuff = () => _runner.Dispose();
}

public class MongoIntegrationTest
{
    internal static MongoDbRunner _runner;
    internal static MongoCollection<TestDocument> _collection;

    internal static void CreateConnection()
    {
        _runner = MongoDbRunner.Start();
        
        MongoServer server = MongoServer.Create(_runner.ConnectionString);
        MongoDatabase database = server.GetDatabase("IntegrationTest");
        _collection = database.GetCollection<TestDocument>("TestCollection");
    }
}    
```

More tests can be found at https://github.com/Mongo2Go/Mongo2Go/tree/master/src/Mongo2GoTests/Runner

**Example: Exporting seed data**

```c#
using (MongoDbRunner runner = MongoDbRunner.StartForDebugging()) {

    runner.Export("TestDatabase", "TestCollection", @"..\..\App_Data\test.json");
}
```

**Example: Importing for local debugging (compatible with ASP.NET MVC 4 Web API as well as ASP.NET Core)**

```c#
public class WebApiApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication
{
    private MongoDbRunner _runner;

    protected void Application_Start()
    {
        _runner = MongoDbRunner.StartForDebugging();
        _runner.Import("TestDatabase", "TestCollection", @"..\..\App_Data\test.json", true);

        MongoServer server = MongoServer.Create(_runner.ConnectionString);
        MongoDatabase database = server.GetDatabase("TestDatabase");
        MongoCollection<TestObject> collection = database.GetCollection<TestObject>("TestCollection");

        /* happy coding! */
    }

    protected void Application_End()
    {
        _runner.Dispose();
    }
}
```

**Example: Transactions (New feature since v2.2.8)**
